# Executive Summary

When imagining the future on a large scale, the first to come to mind are futuristic buildings, flying cars and new forms of technology. On the smaller scale, the future comes in the form of neighborhood change. Our goal as a team, is to analyze neighborhood change between the years 2000-2017 using Census data. Once we can take a look at the changes that have occurred, we are able to evaluate programs we believe to be essential to revitalize communities. Specifically, we will be evaluating if governmental programs, NMTC and LIHTC are successful in facilitating economic development in distressing communities.
